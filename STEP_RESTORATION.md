# Step Configuration Restoration - Update Summary

## Issue Identified
The original step configuration functionality was missing from the React conversion, despite being a fundamental feature of the Azure Container Apps Cost Calculator.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created StepConfiguration Component (`/src/components/calculator/StepConfiguration.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Provides UI for creating, editing, and managing scheduling steps
- **Features**:
  - Add/remove steps dynamically
  - Day selection with visual badges
  - Time range configuration (start/end)
  - Instance count specification
  - Apply steps to schedule functionality
  - Visual feedback and validation

### 2. Created ScheduleGrid Component (`/src/components/calculator/ScheduleGrid.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of the weekly schedule grid (7 days × 24 hours)
- **Features**:
  - Color-coded cells based on instance count
  - Manual editing of individual time slots
  - Responsive design with horizontal scroll
  - Legend for understanding color coding
  - Real-time updates when schedule changes

### 3. Created SchedulePresets Component (`/src/components/calculator/SchedulePresets.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Quick preset buttons for common scheduling patterns
- **Presets Available**:
  - **Business Hours**: Mon-Fri 9-18 (2 instances)
  - **Extended Hours**: Mon-Fri 6-23 (2 instances), weekends full day (1 instance)
  - **24/7 Service**: Always on (2 instances)
  - **Clear All**: Reset entire schedule to 0 instances

### 4. Enhanced useCalculator Hook
- **Added**: `initializeDefaultSteps()` function that creates 3 example steps:
  - Step 1: Mon-Fri 6-23 with 2 instances
  - Step 2: Sat-Sun 6-23 with 1 instance  
  - Step 3: All days 23-6 with 0 instances (night hours)
- **Preserved**: All original step management logic from the vanilla JS version

### 5. Updated Tailwind Configuration
- **Added**: `grid-cols-25` custom grid class for the 25-column schedule grid (1 day label + 24 hours)

### 6. Updated Home Page (`/src/routes/home.tsx`)
- **Added**: StepConfiguration section
- **Added**: ScheduleGrid section  
- **Added**: SchedulePresets section
- **Removed**: Redundant "Calculate Detailed Costs" button (now integrated in step configuration)

## Core Functionality Restored

### ✅ Step-Based Scheduling
- Users can create multiple scheduling rules
- Each step defines days, time range, and instance count
- Steps can overlap (last applied step takes precedence)
- Apply button processes all steps and updates the schedule grid

### ✅ Visual Schedule Management
- 7×24 grid showing the entire week
- Color-coded visualization based on instance count
- Manual editing capabilities for fine-tuning
- Real-time cost calculations

### ✅ Quick Presets
- Instant application of common patterns
- Business, extended, 24/7, and clear options
- Immediate visual feedback in the grid

### ✅ Cost Calculations
- Real-time calculation based on active instance hours
- Only running instances incur costs (Container Apps scales to zero)
- Regional pricing support
- Efficiency metrics and detailed breakdowns

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
interface CalculatorState {
  selectedCombination: number;
  selectedRegion: string;
  schedule: Schedule; // 7×24 matrix of instance counts
  configSteps: ScheduleStep[]; // Array of scheduling rules
}
```

### Step Processing Logic
The `applySteps()` function processes each step sequentially:
1. Clears existing schedule
2. For each step, applies instance count to specified days/hours
3. Handles overnight shifts (crossing midnight)
4. Updates the schedule state, triggering UI refresh

## User Experience Improvements

### From Original HTML/JS Version:
- ✅ **All step functionality preserved and enhanced**
- ✅ **Better visual design with shadcn/ui components**
- ✅ **Improved responsive layout**
- ✅ **Type safety with TypeScript**
- ✅ **Modular component architecture**
- ✅ **Real-time validation and feedback**

### Enhanced Features:
- **Visual badges** for day selection instead of checkboxes
- **Integrated apply button** within step configuration
- **Better mobile responsiveness** for the schedule grid
- **Consistent design language** throughout all components
- **Accessibility improvements** with proper labels and focus management

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Step configuration UI functional
- [x] Add/remove steps working
- [x] Day/time/instance editing functional  
- [x] Apply steps updates schedule grid
- [x] Schedule grid displays correctly
- [x] Manual schedule editing works
- [x] Preset buttons apply correctly
- [x] Cost calculations updated in real-time
- [x] All TypeScript types properly defined
- [x] No compilation errors
- [x] Visual design consistent with shadcn/ui

## Next Steps

The step configuration functionality has been fully restored and enhanced. The React version now includes all the core features of the original HTML/JS calculator while providing a modern, type-safe, and maintainable codebase.

**Status**: ✅ **Complete - Step functionality fully restored**
